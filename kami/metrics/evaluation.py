    The ``evaluation`` module to assess text recognition (OCR/HTR) metrics
    ======================================================================

    Use this module standalone with :py:class:`kami.metrics.evaluation.Scorer()`
    class in evaluation or as part of KaMI :py:class:`kami.pipeline.Core()` class
    in pipeline module to assess text recognition (OCR/HTR) metrics.

    Metrics overview in KaMI
    ------------------------

    Distance metrics
    ****************

    To compute distance KaMI use C extension module from
    `Python-Levensthein <https://rawgit.com/ztane/python-Levenshtein/master/docs/Levenshtein.html>`_
    package.

    **Levenshtein distance** (or edit distance) :
                                                 Gives a measure of the difference between two strings.
                                                 It is equal to the minimum number of characters that must be deleted,
                                                 inserted or replaced to switch from one string to another.

    .. note :: In KaMI, you can access to distance on words and characters. These two kind of distance are utils
              for compute WER and CER.

    **Hamming distance** :
                          It very close from Levenshtein distance definition but gives a measure only between two strings
                          have the same length.

    Recognition measure
    *******************

    **Word Error Rate (WER)**:
                              The word error rate is derived from the Levenshtein distance
                              which works at word level instead of characters. It indicates the
                              rate of incorrectly recognized words compared to a reference text.
                              The lower the rate (minimum 0.0), the better the recognition.
                              The maximum rate is not limited and can exceed 1.0 in the event
                              of very poor recognition if there are many insertions.

                              In KaMI, the WER is bounded between 0 and 1 and it is calculated as

                              .. math::

                                \\frac{D(R,H)}{total\,words} \,where \,D \,is \,Levenshtein \,distance

    **Character Error Rate (CER)**:
                                   As WER, the character error rate which works at character level
                                   instead of words. In Kami as WER, the rate is bounded between 0 and 1.

    **Word accuracy (Wacc)**:
                              The word accuracy calculates the number of perfectly recognized words
                              and helps assess overall recognition of HTR/ OCR.
                              This recognition rate can be negative.

                              In kami, it is calculated as (1-WER), where 1 corresponding to
                              the best score.

    **Character information preserved (CIP)**:
                                              It is roughly equivalent to word accuracy but it work on character.

                                              In kami, It is calculated as number of
                                              (H/total characters of reference) * (H/total characters of hypothesis)
                                              where H number of correctly recognized characters.

    **Character information lost (CIL)**:
                                          In kami, It is calculated as 1 - CIP. The lower the rate,
                                          the more information has disappeared.

    **Match error rate (MER)**:
                                the lower the rate, more errors are minimized and
                                better the recognition of characters is effective. It corresponds to an
                                overall error ratio of text recognition. It's a another way
                                to compute CER.

                                In kami, It is calculated as S + D + I / H + S + D + I

    Access to different metrics with :py:class:`kami.metrics.evaluation.Scorer()`
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

    First, can use attribute define in :py:class:`kami.metrics.evaluation.Scorer()` (see the documentation)

        :Example:

        >>> import kami.metrics.evaluation as kamiscorer
        >>> my_scorer = kamiscorer.Scorer("Les treize ans de Maxime ?", "Les tesise aS de MAxime ?")
        >>> my_scorer.wer
        0.5
        >>> my_scorer.cer
        0.23076923076923078
        >>> my_scorer.lev_distance_char
        6
        >>> ...

    Can truncate or pass in percentage score with parameters

        :Example:

        >>> import kami.metrics.evaluation as kamiscorer
        >>> my_scorer = kamiscorer.Scorer("Les treize ans de Maxime ?", "Les tesise aS de MAxime ?", truncate_score=True)
        >>> my_scorer.cer
        0.23
        >>> my_scorer = kamiscorer.Scorer("Les treize ans de Maxime ?", "Les tesise aS de MAxime ?", show_percent=True)
        >>> my_scorer.wer
        50.0

    Can catch number of keeped, substituted, deleted or inserted characters individually

        :Example:

        >>> import kami.metrics.evaluation as kamiscorer
        >>> my_scorer.hits
        20
        >>> my_scorer.substs
        5
        >>> my_scorer.deletions
        1
        >>> my_scorer.insertions
        0

    Finally, can retrieve all the metrics in dictionnary with `.board` attribute

        :Example:

        >>> my_scorer = kamiscorer.Scorer("Les treize ans de Maxime ?", "Les tesise aS de MAxime ?", truncate_score=True)
        >>> my_scorer.board

        'hits': 20,
        'substitutions': 5,
        'deletions': 1,
        'insertions': 0}

    .. note:: Can modulate the severity of the scores by going through a
              normalization of the character sequences with class :py:class:`kami.preprocessing.evaluation.Composer()`

    .. seealso:: :py:class:`kami.metrics.evaluation.Scorer()` and :py:class:`kami.pipeline.Core()`
